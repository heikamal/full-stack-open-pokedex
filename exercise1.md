For this exercise, the language of my choice is going to be Ruby, mainly because it's the language I know the least about from the given examples.

Looking around for specific tools for linting in Ruby, the name of RuboCop seems to be popping up. According to their own overview, RuboCop is a Ruby code style checker and formatter based on the community-driven Ruby Style Guide. Discussions about it seem positive and most users praise it's customizability suiting many different styles. Other than RuboCop, I mostly managed to find different configurations for RuboCop or IDEs' own syntax settings which don't really take care of styling and formatting. Searching for different testing tools for Ruby seems to yield much more different options. Rspec, the most prominent I found, is a framework composed of multiple smaller libraries for different usecases and even used with other frameworks. Others I found include MiniTest, which is praised for it's simplicity, Capybara for testing web applications and Cucumber for testing GERKIN. For the build tools, it's not really necessary because Ruby itself is an interpreted language, but to make things easier, Ruby code can be bundled into a gem that is easy to publish. For creating gems, one can use RubyGems' own built in tools or a tool called Bundler.

Alternatives to Jenkins and Github Actions are many, but some of the most successful I found seems to be Azure DevOps, Gitlab or Amazon Web Services. Most of these offer cloud-based solutions but also software for self-hosting CI setup.

It's difficult to say which option is better for our hypothetical situation. Of course, it's a small team but it doesn't necessarily mean that the project itself is not complicated or doesn't have any special requirements. To make the decision, we would need to figure out all the necessary requirements for testing and building and see if there is a cloud-based environment that suits those needs and if it'll become cheaper to use their services versus hosting your own environment.
